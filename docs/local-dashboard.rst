Understanding SDGs Tracking

The bubble graph is where the user can see which SDG is being more tracked related to others.
In other words, it shows the numbers of received messages from questions that are linked to the respective SDG.

There are two separate sections to display the SDGs tracking status. The order doesn't interfere on the bubble size, it is ordered by crescent numerical order.
To provide a better readability there is a tooltip on each bubble displaying the SDG name and also the received messages count.
