Registering and Managing UNCTs
------------------------------
Global Super Administrator users can manage new and already registered UNCTs (United Nations Country Teams).
The managing process is simple and allow these administrators to control UNCT information, such as:

* UNCT Name
* RapidPro workspace token
* Timezone
* Language
* RapidPro contact fields

These configurations defines the bridge between RapidPro and RTM, so it represents an important step on the RTM setup.
